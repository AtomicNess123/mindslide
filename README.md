#Mindslide

View mindmap as an HTML animation / presentation (aka Freeplane/Freemind to powerpoint slideshow).

Checkout our **[online demonstration & documentation](http://berteh.github.io/mindslide/)**!


Mindslide is an export extension for [Freeplane](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane). It uses the [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) HTML presentation framework to make stunning slideshow presentations and animations from your Freeplane (and possibly Freemind) mindmaps.
